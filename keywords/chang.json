            "As of February 4, 2013, Canadian Tire has adopted the fair rounding approach for CASH transactions. When proper change is not available, the amount owing after tax will be rounded to the nearest. 05. Rounded down: If the last digit of the amount is 1, 2, 6 or 7. Rounded up: If the last digit of the amount is 3, 4, 8 or 9. Rounding does not apply to Debit, Credit or Gift Card payments, unless it is a split payment, in which case, split payment rules apply. On split payment transactions, if cash is the last method of payment used, the amount owing will be subjected to rounding. If cash is not the last payment type tendered, no rounding will take effect. You can still pay the unrounded total in cash if you have the correct change. For example, if the amount owing after tax is 10. 03, and you have 3 pennies, you can pay the unrounded total. These rules apply to U. S. currency as well. Canadian Tire Money will be issued on the pre-rounded amount. Rounding will also be applied to refunds paid out in cash. Purchases made with Gift Cards will be settled to the exact amount. Auto Work orders are also subject to rounding, which is done at the register. Therefore, the total on the work order may not match the total being paid at the register. {removed href} Returns.",

            "This page sets out important information about the Triangle Rewards program (the Program) the program that rewards you with electronic Canadian Tire Money when you shop at participating Canadian Tire stores, on-line at {removed hyperref} and at Canadian Tire gas bars. The Program is made available by Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited (referred to as Canadian Tire or we) on the following terms and conditions. Participating in the Program In order to collect and redeem electronic Canadian Tire Money (eCTM), you must become a member (a Member). Membership is open to you if you are an individual, you reside in Canada and you are of the age of majority in the province in which you reside. You can become a Member by (i) completing the registration process online at {removed hyperref} (the Program Website) or (ii) by downloading the Program application to your mobile phone or device (the Program App) which you can receive information on by calling Program customer service at 1-800-226-8473 or by visiting the Program Website, or (iii) by applying for a credit card issued by Canadian Tire Bank that is designated as being linked to the Program or by being issued a debit card connected to a bank account from Canadian Tire Bank that is designated as being linked to the Program (a Program Payment Card), or (iv) by calling customer service at 1-800-226-8473 after you have picked up a Triangle Rewards Card in store. If you apply for a credit card that is a Program Payment Card and are not approved you will still become a Member of the Triangle Rewards Program if you provided all of the necessary information unless, at time of application for such credit card, you were advised that you would have to enroll separately in the Triangle Rewards Program in the event your credit card application was declined or unless we otherwise notify you in writing. Triangle Rewards Cards Each Member may receive a Triangle Rewards Program card (a Triangle Rewards Card) that is linked to a Triangle Rewards Account. Your eCTM will be stored in that account. If you do not receive a Triangle Rewards Card you will need to use a Cardless Method (see below) when you collect or redeem eCTM. Any Program Payment Cards that are issued to a Member will also be linked to that Members Triangle Rewards Account. If a Member has multiple Program Payment Cards they cannot be linked to the same Triangle Rewards Account. A Member can request the issuance of additional Triangle Rewards Cards that have the same account number as that Members Triangle Rewards Account. Collecting electronic Canadian Tire Money eCTM can be collected when you purchase Eligible Merchandise (see below) at participating Canadian Tire stores or on-line at {removed hyperref} (or such other web site as may be designated by Canadian Tire from time to time). eCTM is calculated on the pre-tax, purchase amount (or eligible portion thereof) and is rounded to the nearest cent. To collect eCTM you must present a Triangle Rewards Card (or use a Cardless Method described below). You can also collect eCTM on that portion of a purchase charged to a Program Payment Card. The Program Payment Card must be linked to a Triangle Rewards Account at the time the purchase is made in order to collect eCTM. eCTM can also be collected when you purchase fuel (gasoline or diesel) at participating Canadian Tire gas bars and present a Triangle Rewards Card (or use a Cardless Method described below) and use a qualifying form of tender or if you pay for the purchase with a Program Payment Card. The amount of eCTM collected on fuel purchases depends on the number of litres purchased. A minimum fuel purchase may be required before eCTM can be collected. The rate of collection may vary from time to time and by location and by type of tender used for payment so check at your local Canadian Tire gas bar. eCTM can only be collected at Canadian Tire gas bars on fuel purchases. You can also collect eCTM on purchases that you make at other merchants that are charged to a Program Payment Card. eCTM that you collect at other merchants will also be rounded to the nearest cent. The rate at which eCTM can be collected may vary from time to time and by location and is subject to change by Canadian Tire without notice. In addition, you may collect eCTM at a different rate if you pay with a Program Payment Card than you would if you use a Triangle Rewards Card (or Cardless Method) or based on the type of Program Payment Card that you use. Please call 1-800-226-8473 for current rates. When shopping at Canadian Tire stores or gas bars, if you forget your Triangle Rewards Card or choose not to use it, you may still be able to collect eCTM on a qualifying purchase if you provide the telephone number that you gave when you enrolled as a Member or you scan at a compatible point of sale device your mobile phone or other mobile device on which you have downloaded the Program App (each of these is a Cardless Method). Purchases made in a foreign currency with a Program Payment Card are first converted into Canadian currency (as set out in the cardmember agreement) prior to calculating the amount of eCTM that you have collected. eCTM can only be collected on one Triangle Rewards Account for each purchase transaction. If you use a Triangle Rewards Card or Cardless Method, it must be swiped or scanned or your phone number provided, as the case may be, before you make your purchase. When shopping online at {removed hyperref} (or other website as designated by Canadian Tire), you must enter your Triangle Rewards Account number at check out to collect eCTM. Members are also eligible to collect bonus eCTM, or to collect eCTM at a promotional rate offered from time to time on the purchase of select items, upon the occurrence of certain events or as part of a promotion or offer, but unless otherwise indicated, bonus eCTM or eCTM awarded at a promotional rate is awarded only once for a transaction, or for the occurrence of an event, as the case may be. You cannot use a Triangle Rewards Card (or Cardless Method) together with a Program Payment Card. If you charge a purchase to a Program Payment Card, you will only earn eCTM at the applicable Program Payment Card rate then in effect, even if you also present your Triangle Rewards Card (or Cardless Method). However, if you redeem eCTM to pay for part of a transaction and pay for the balance of the transaction with a Program Payment Card that is linked to a different Triangle Rewards Account than the account from which the redemption is occurring, all eCTM collected in respect of that transaction will be credited to the Triangle Rewards Account from which redemption is occurring. You will not be able to collect eCTM on that portion of a transaction in respect of which you redeemed eCTM. However, we may, from time to time and at our discretion, have special offers or promotions that would allow you to collect eCTM on that portion of a transaction in respect of which you redeemed eCTM. If you use more than one Program Payment Card to make a purchase (e. g. split the cost between two or more cards), all eCTM collected on that purchase will be credited only to the Triangle Rewards Account linked to the first Program Payment Card that is presented. If you make payment using a Program Payment Card in combination with some other form of tender, only that portion of the purchase charged to the Program Payment Card will earn eCTM at the then applicable Program Payment Card rate. That portion of the purchases made with the other form of tender may be eligible to earn eCTM at a different rate. Delays may occur in recording eCTM to a Triangle Rewards Account. You cannot collect paper Canadian Tire Money and eCTM on the same transaction. If you are the holder of a Program Payment Card and you fail to keep your credit card account, or bank account to which your debit card is linked, in good standing, any eCTM that you might have collected as a result of transactions with that Program Payment Card, may, in Canadian Tires sole discretion, be cancelled.

You may not redeem eCTM from more than one Triangle Rewards Account for the same transaction. You must have enrolled in the Program, or have activated your Program Payment Card, in order to redeem eCTM. What Happens When an Item is Returned? If you return an item for a refund and had received eCTM when you purchased such item, such amount of eCTM will be deducted from your Triangle Rewards Account. Merchandise that was purchased either in whole or in part by redeeming eCTM may not be returned for cash, rather, the connected Triangle Rewards Account will be credited with the same amount of eCTM used to make the original purchase. Expiration of Electronic Canadian Tire MoneyWe may expire the eCTM in your Triangle Rewards Account in the event that there has been a period of inactivity of 18 months or more.

We will also send you email invitations to events that we are hosting or attending, and we will contact you on special occasions. The data you enter in the input mask when subscribing to our newsletter will be sent to us. We use the so-called double opt-in process for subscriptions to our newsletter. In other words, once you have provided your email address, we will send you an email to confirm whether you would like to receive the newsletter. We will only start sending you newsletters once you have clicked on the confirmation link. If you do not confirm your subscription within 96 hours, it will be automatically deleted. The legal basis for the processing of data sent in course of newsletter subscriptions is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. Any data you provide will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. Thus, your email address will only be stored for as long as your newsletter subscription is active. You have the right to revoke your consent at any time by contacting Sharp NEC Display Solutions Europe GmbH via email ({removed hyperref}) or in writing at the address indicated above. You can revoke your consent to email advertising by clicking on the unsubscribe link contained in every email. If you revoke your consent, this will not affect the legality of any data processing carried out on the basis of your consent before the date of revocation. NEWSLETTER TRACKING Our newsletters feature standard technologies that enable us to measure interactions (e. g. whether the newsletter has been opened, which links have been clicked on) and to display targeted news based on your user behaviour. If you visit our website after selecting a newsletter link, we will merge any subsequently obtained data with the information on your user behaviour. We will use the data collected to conduct general statistical evaluations, to optimise and develop our content and customer communication, and to display targeted and personalised advertising. This process is facilitated by embedding cookies and small graphics (pixels) in the newsletter. Cookies are small files that are saved on your disk; they store certain settings and data to be exchanged with our system via your browser. Cookies cannot run any programmes or transmit viruses to your computer. They help to improve the overall user-friendliness and efficiency of our website. We want to use our newsletter to share relevant content with our customers and gain a better understanding of our readers interests. We perform our newsletter tracking with IBM Watson Campaign Automation, a service provided by IBM, International Business Machines Corp., New Orchard Road Armonk, New York 10504, USA (IBM). Of course, this is only possible if you have previously consented to receiving our personalised newsletter (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR).
