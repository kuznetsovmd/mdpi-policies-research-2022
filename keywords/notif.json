BY PROVIDING YOUR INFORMATION TO CANADIAN TIRE, YOU CONSENT TO CANADIAN TIRE USING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OUTLINED ABOVE.

WE OBTAIN YOUR CONSENT TO COLLECT, USE OR DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION Canadian Tire obtains your consent to collect, use or disclose your personal information, except as otherwise permitted by law.

BENEFITS YOU RECEIVE THROUGH CONSENT Canadian Tire is a growing network of interrelated businesses offering a unique mix of products and services.

THE CONSEQUENCES OF WITHDRAWING OR REFUSING CONSENT If you decide to withdraw or refuse your consent, our ability to communicate with you may be diminished. For example, we will generally not be able to tell you about price discounts, rewards, customized balance transfer offers, contests, or other products and services that may be of value to you. 4. WE LIMIT COLLECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION Canadian Tire collects the information required to provide products and services to you and as otherwise outlined in this Privacy Charter.

We may request certain personal information for the purposes of verifying the identity of the individual seeking access to their personal information records. 10.

            "This page sets out important information about the Triangle Rewards program (the Program) the program that rewards you with electronic Canadian Tire Money when you shop at participating Canadian Tire stores, on-line at {removed hyperref} and at Canadian Tire gas bars. The Program is made available by Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited (referred to as Canadian Tire or we) on the following terms and conditions. Participating in the Program In order to collect and redeem electronic Canadian Tire Money (eCTM), you must become a member (a Member). Membership is open to you if you are an individual, you reside in Canada and you are of the age of majority in the province in which you reside. You can become a Member by (i) completing the registration process online at {removed hyperref} (the Program Website) or (ii) by downloading the Program application to your mobile phone or device (the Program App) which you can receive information on by calling Program customer service at 1-800-226-8473 or by visiting the Program Website, or (iii) by applying for a credit card issued by Canadian Tire Bank that is designated as being linked to the Program or by being issued a debit card connected to a bank account from Canadian Tire Bank that is designated as being linked to the Program (a Program Payment Card), or (iv) by calling customer service at 1-800-226-8473 after you have picked up a Triangle Rewards Card in store. If you apply for a credit card that is a Program Payment Card and are not approved you will still become a Member of the Triangle Rewards Program if you provided all of the necessary information unless, at time of application for such credit card, you were advised that you would have to enroll separately in the Triangle Rewards Program in the event your credit card application was declined or unless we otherwise notify you in writing. Triangle Rewards Cards Each Member may receive a Triangle Rewards Program card (a Triangle Rewards Card) that is linked to a Triangle Rewards Account. Your eCTM will be stored in that account. If you do not receive a Triangle Rewards Card you will need to use a Cardless Method (see below) when you collect or redeem eCTM. Any Program Payment Cards that are issued to a Member will also be linked to that Members Triangle Rewards Account. If a Member has multiple Program Payment Cards they cannot be linked to the same Triangle Rewards Account. A Member can request the issuance of additional Triangle Rewards Cards that have the same account number as that Members Triangle Rewards Account. Collecting electronic Canadian Tire Money eCTM can be collected when you purchase Eligible Merchandise (see below) at participating Canadian Tire stores or on-line at {removed hyperref} (or such other web site as may be designated by Canadian Tire from time to time). eCTM is calculated on the pre-tax, purchase amount (or eligible portion thereof) and is rounded to the nearest cent. To collect eCTM you must present a Triangle Rewards Card (or use a Cardless Method described below). You can also collect eCTM on that portion of a purchase charged to a Program Payment Card. The Program Payment Card must be linked to a Triangle Rewards Account at the time the purchase is made in order to collect eCTM. eCTM can also be collected when you purchase fuel (gasoline or diesel) at participating Canadian Tire gas bars and present a Triangle Rewards Card (or use a Cardless Method described below) and use a qualifying form of tender or if you pay for the purchase with a Program Payment Card. The amount of eCTM collected on fuel purchases depends on the number of litres purchased. A minimum fuel purchase may be required before eCTM can be collected. The rate of collection may vary from time to time and by location and by type of tender used for payment so check at your local Canadian Tire gas bar. eCTM can only be collected at Canadian Tire gas bars on fuel purchases. You can also collect eCTM on purchases that you make at other merchants that are charged to a Program Payment Card. eCTM that you collect at other merchants will also be rounded to the nearest cent. The rate at which eCTM can be collected may vary from time to time and by location and is subject to change by Canadian Tire without notice. In addition, you may collect eCTM at a different rate if you pay with a Program Payment Card than you would if you use a Triangle Rewards Card (or Cardless Method) or based on the type of Program Payment Card that you use. Please call 1-800-226-8473 for current rates. When shopping at Canadian Tire stores or gas bars, if you forget your Triangle Rewards Card or choose not to use it, you may still be able to collect eCTM on a qualifying purchase if you provide the telephone number that you gave when you enrolled as a Member or you scan at a compatible point of sale device your mobile phone or other mobile device on which you have downloaded the Program App (each of these is a Cardless Method). Purchases made in a foreign currency with a Program Payment Card are first converted into Canadian currency (as set out in the cardmember agreement) prior to calculating the amount of eCTM that you have collected. eCTM can only be collected on one Triangle Rewards Account for each purchase transaction. If you use a Triangle Rewards Card or Cardless Method, it must be swiped or scanned or your phone number provided, as the case may be, before you make your purchase. When shopping online at {removed hyperref} (or other website as designated by Canadian Tire), you must enter your Triangle Rewards Account number at check out to collect eCTM. Members are also eligible to collect bonus eCTM, or to collect eCTM at a promotional rate offered from time to time on the purchase of select items, upon the occurrence of certain events or as part of a promotion or offer, but unless otherwise indicated, bonus eCTM or eCTM awarded at a promotional rate is awarded only once for a transaction, or for the occurrence of an event, as the case may be. You cannot use a Triangle Rewards Card (or Cardless Method) together with a Program Payment Card. If you charge a purchase to a Program Payment Card, you will only earn eCTM at the applicable Program Payment Card rate then in effect, even if you also present your Triangle Rewards Card (or Cardless Method). However, if you redeem eCTM to pay for part of a transaction and pay for the balance of the transaction with a Program Payment Card that is linked to a different Triangle Rewards Account than the account from which the redemption is occurring, all eCTM collected in respect of that transaction will be credited to the Triangle Rewards Account from which redemption is occurring. You will not be able to collect eCTM on that portion of a transaction in respect of which you redeemed eCTM. However, we may, from time to time and at our discretion, have special offers or promotions that would allow you to collect eCTM on that portion of a transaction in respect of which you redeemed eCTM. If you use more than one Program Payment Card to make a purchase (e. g. split the cost between two or more cards), all eCTM collected on that purchase will be credited only to the Triangle Rewards Account linked to the first Program Payment Card that is presented. If you make payment using a Program Payment Card in combination with some other form of tender, only that portion of the purchase charged to the Program Payment Card will earn eCTM at the then applicable Program Payment Card rate. That portion of the purchases made with the other form of tender may be eligible to earn eCTM at a different rate. Delays may occur in recording eCTM to a Triangle Rewards Account. You cannot collect paper Canadian Tire Money and eCTM on the same transaction. If you are the holder of a Program Payment Card and you fail to keep your credit card account, or bank account to which your debit card is linked, in good standing, any eCTM that you might have collected as a result of transactions with that Program Payment Card, may, in Canadian Tires sole discretion, be cancelled.

In addition, individual Canadian Tire stores may exclude additional items sold in that store from being Eligible Merchandise. We reserve the right, at any time without notice, to change what constitutes Eligible Merchandise. Redeeming electronic Canadian Tire Money eCTM can only be redeemed for merchandise (including applicable taxes) at participating Canadian Tire stores or at other locations designated by Canadian Tire. eCTM cannot be redeemed for alcohol, tobacco, gift cards, pre-paid cards, other stored value cards or products, items that we designate on the Program Website and those items which the law does not permit to be purchased this way, or used to make a payment on any Canadian Tire Bank issued credit cards or on loans or for financial or insurance products or in respect of fees or overdraft on any Canadian Tire Bank provided bank account. To redeem your eCTM you must present your Triangle Rewards Card (or Cardless Method) or Program Payment Card to the cashier with your purchase.

If you return an item for a refund and had received eCTM when you purchased such item, such amount of eCTM will be deducted from your Triangle Rewards Account. Merchandise that was purchased either in whole or in part by redeeming eCTM may not be returned for cash, rather, the connected Triangle Rewards Account will be credited with the same amount of eCTM used to make the original purchase. Expiration of Electronic Canadian Tire MoneyWe may expire the eCTM in your Triangle Rewards Account in the event that there has been a period of inactivity of 18 months or more. For the purposes of this section, inactivity means that there has been neither a transaction in which you have collected eCTM, nor a transaction in which you have redeemed eCTM during the period in {removed hyperref} of Membership and Cancellation of the Program Membership may be terminated by Canadian Tire if any of the following events occur: (A) the Member has failed to comply with any of these terms and conditions, or Canadian Tire determines that the Member has abused the Program or has made any misrepresentation or false statement to Canadian Tire; (B) the Member dies; (C) the Member becomes bankrupt or insolvent or any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings are commenced by or against the Member, (D) the Member is charged with a designated offence (as defined in the Criminal Code (Canada)), (E) the Members Program Payment Card is terminated by Canadian Tire Bank, or (F) Canadian Tire suspects the Member of any fraudulent activity in connection with the Program or the use of a Program Payment Card.

            "WHY: We collect this information to help get your Sonos Product and/or Service working securely (which helps prevent unauthorised access to your Sonos Products, Services, or home network) and to make sure that we enable you to select the right music service options based on your geographic location (e. g. radio stations available in your country). This processing is necessary for the performance of the contract we have with you. We also use your email to send you Sonos-related notifications, such as promotional messages, software updates, information about Sonos Products and/or Services, and to share exciting Sonos news and Product offerings. It is our legitimate interest to process your personal data for these purposes. Using Sonos Products and Services There are three main reasons we collect information from your Sonos Products: (1) to offer you music services or other audio content choices (e. g. radio, tv or games) which is necessary for the performance of the agreement we have with you, (2) to offer you control over your Sonos system which is necessary for the performance of the agreement we have with you, and (3) to make your Sonos Products better over time which is our legitimate interest.",
            "VOICE CONTROL. Voice control works by your voice-enabled Sonos Product listening for a key wake-up word. Please note, not all Sonos Products are voice-enabled, and if your Sonos Product is voice-enabled, you will have to actively enable your Sonos Product to start listening. In further detail, this listening means that voice-enabled Sonos Products buffer and re-record locally, without transmitting or storing any information, until they detect the word or phrase (such as Alexa) that triggers the device to begin actively recording. If the Product does not detect the wake-up word, it continues to record over itself in a never ending loop lasting a few seconds. This is all done locally on your Product and is not sent to Sonos or any third party. If a wake-up word is detected, the Sonos Product begins recording. In other words, it does not record or retain any audio data, or begin to transmit any data until it is woken up. You are notified that it is recording by a visual element, such as a light on the Sonos Product, and a specific sound. The Product will record until your voice command is finished. The actual recording of your voice command is then sent to the voice partner you have authorised to receive such recording (for example, Amazon). SONOS DOES NOT RETAIN A COPY OF YOUR VOICE RECORDING. Concurrent with the voice recording, your Product will collect data (for example, decibel level at each frequency) about the ambient noise in the room. It is not possible to extract any speech from this type of data. We collect this data to help us improve our speech recognition technology which is our legitimate interest. If you are trying to state a voice command whilst music is playing for example, Sonos may improve the technology by lowering the music so that your voice command can be understood properly.",
            "Advertising Partners If you decide to use Sonos Radio, we will share a subset of your pseudonymised and anonymised data with third party advertising companies to present, via Sonos Products, interest-based ads for features, products, and services that might be of interest to you. Specifically, we share the following information with our advertising partners: location, language, and genre of the station you are currently listening to (which is not based on your overall listening history). We will share anonymous information with advertisers, which describes the overall listening audience in general. We may also share limited location information (i. e. an IP address and anonymised ID) with some of our third-party radio content partners who may run ads on their stations. We do not use information that personally identifies you to present interest-based ads. Sonos-controlled Affiliates and Subsidiaries We share information with Sonos-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries for business purposes, such as internal administration, promoting Sonos Products, and providing customers with our Sonos Products and Services. It is our legitimate interest to share information with these parties for these purposes. Compelled Disclosure and Law Enforcement When legally required, strictly necessary for the performance of the services or to protect our rights, or the rights of our affiliates or users, we disclose your personal information to law enforcement authorities, investigative organisations, our affiliates, or in legal proceedings.

Sale or Merger We may share your personal information in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets. Of course, we shall notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our website and inform you of your rights.
